# Exercise 6.11 Cities:
#   Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in 
# your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and 
# include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one 
# fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something
# like country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of 
# the information you have stored about it.
