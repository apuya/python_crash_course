# Exercise 6.9 Favorite Places:
#   Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as 
# keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each 
# person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to 
# name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print
# each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.

   'mark': ['hawaii', 'oregon coast', 'california'],
   'troy': ['laguna beach', 'disney land', 'santa monica'],
