# Exercise 9.4 Number Served:
#   Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an attribute 
# called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance called
# restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the restaurant has 
# served, and then change this value and print it again.
#   Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
# customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print
# the value again.
#   Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the 
# number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number you 
# like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of 
# business.
