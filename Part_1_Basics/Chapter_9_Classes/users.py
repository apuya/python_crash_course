# Exercise 9.3 Users:
#   Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and 
# last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored 
# in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary 
# of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that 
# prints a personalized greeting to the user. 
#   Create several instances representing different users, and call both 
# methods for each user.
