# Exercise 2.8 Number Eight:
# Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that
# each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print()
# calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
#
# print(5+3)
#
# Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on 
# each line.

# add + 
print(5 + 3)

# subtract - 
print(10 - 2)

# multiply * 
print(4 * 2)

# divid /
print(16 / 2)
