# Exercise 2.10 Adding Comments:
# Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t 
# have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add 
# your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
# describing what the program does.
