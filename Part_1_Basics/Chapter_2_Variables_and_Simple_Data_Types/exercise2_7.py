# Exercise 2.7 Stripping Name:
# Use a variable to represent a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the 
# beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
#   Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using 
#   each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
