# Chapter 3: Introducing Lists
#
# Exercise 3.1 Names:
# Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each personâ€™s 
# name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

# List: is a collection of items in a particular order.
# Square brackets [] indicate a list, elements in the list are separated by commas.

names = ['Alex', 'Jaxon', 'Nick', 'Troy', 'Sam']
print(names)

# You can access elements in a list by calling its position

print(names[0]) # Displays the first item on the list

print(names[1]) # Displays the second item on the list

print(names[2]) # Displays the third item on the list

print(names[3]) # Displays the fourth item on the list

print(names[4]) # Displays the fifth item on the list
