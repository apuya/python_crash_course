# Chapter 3: Introducing Lists
#
# Exercise 3.2 Greetings:
# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing 
# each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should 
# be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

names = ['Alex', 'Jaxon', 'Nick', 'Troy', 'Sam']
print(names)

print(f"Hey {names[0]}, how is your day going?") 
print(f"{names[1]}, kickback tonight, my place, be there!")
print(f"Yooo {names[2]}, epic party!")
print(f"Hey {names[3]}, it's been a while. How are you?")
print(f"{names[4]}, were you able to finish the Python Project?")
