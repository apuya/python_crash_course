# Exercise 3.3 Your Own List:
#   Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a 
# car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a 
# series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda 
# motorcycle.”

cars = ['Tesla', 'Lexus', 'Chevrolet']

print(f"The first car I owned was a {cars[2]}.")
print(f"I currently drive a {cars[1]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {cars[0]} one day.")
