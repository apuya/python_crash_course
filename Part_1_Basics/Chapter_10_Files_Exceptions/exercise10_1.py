# Exercise 10.1 Learning Python:
# Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. 
# Start each line with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory 
# as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print 
# the contents once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by stor- ing the lines 
# in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
