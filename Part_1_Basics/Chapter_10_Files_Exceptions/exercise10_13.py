# Exercise 10.13 Verify User:
# The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the user has already entered their username or that the program 
# is running for the first time. We should modify it in case the current user is not the person who last used the program.
# Before printing a welcome back message in greet_user(), ask the user if this is the correct username. If itâ€™s not, call 
# get_new_username() to get the correct username.
