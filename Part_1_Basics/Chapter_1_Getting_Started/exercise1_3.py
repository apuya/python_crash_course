# Exercise 1.3 Infinite Skills:
# If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? You’re about to learn how to program. 
# If you have an end goal in mind, you’ll have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time 
# to draft descrip- tions of what you want to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas” notebook that 
# you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take a few minutes now to describe three
# programs you want to create.

# 1. Develope an IOS game.
# 2. Automated trading system.
# 3. Machine Learning.
