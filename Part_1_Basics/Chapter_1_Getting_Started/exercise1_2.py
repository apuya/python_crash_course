# Exercise 1.2 Hello World Typos:
# Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. 
# Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that 
# doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

print("Hello Python world!") # Prints out Hello Python world!

print("Hello Python word!") # typo within the parentheses, no errror. Prints out Hello Python word!

# Priint("Hello Python world!") # typo outside the parentheses, "Priint" Creates a syntax error
