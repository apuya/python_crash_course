# Exercise 1.2 Hello World Typos:
#   Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the
# line and run the program again. Can you make a typo that generates an error?
# Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn’t 
# generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

print("Hello Python world!") # Prints out Hello Python world!

# typo within the parentheses, no errror. Prints out Hello Python word!
print("Hello Python word!") 

# typo outside the parentheses, "Priint" Creates a syntax error
# Priint("Hello Python world!")
