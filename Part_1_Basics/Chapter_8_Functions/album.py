# Chapter 8: Functions
#
# Exercise 8.7 Album:
#   Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a 
# music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, 
# and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. 
# Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
# Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album 
# information correctly.
#   Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to 
# store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value 
# for the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at 
# least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.
