# Exercise 8.12 Sandwiches:
#   Write a function that accepts a list of items a person wants on a sandwich. 
# The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the 
# function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich thatâ€™s 
# being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of 
# arguments each time.
