# Exercise 8.10 Sending Messages:
#   Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. Write a function 
# called send_messages() that prints each text message and moves each message 
# to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. After calling the 
# function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved 
# correctly.
