# Think of at least three different animals that have a common char- acteristic. Store the names of these animals 
# in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.

# • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as
#   A dog would make a great pet.
# • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence 
#   such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
