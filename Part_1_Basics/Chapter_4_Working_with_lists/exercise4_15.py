# Exercise 4.15 Code Review:
#  Choose three of the programs you’ve written in this chapter and modify each 
#  one to comply with PEP 8:
#
# • Use four spaces for each indentation level. Set your text editor to insert 
#   four spaces every time you press tab, if you haven’t already done so (see 
#   Appendix B for instructions on how to do this).
# • Use less than 80 characters on each line, and set your editor to show a 
#   vertical guideline at the 80th character position.
# • Don’t use blank lines excessively in your program files.
