# Chapter 5: If Statements
#
# Exercise 5.1 Conditional Tests:
#   Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test 
# and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look 
# something like this:
#    
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
#
# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line 
#   evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and 
#   another five tests evaluate to False.

# Conditional test evaluates of a statment is true or falls

# Double equal sign == is used as the equality operator. It returns true if the 
# values on the left and right side are equal.
