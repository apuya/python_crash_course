# Exercise 5.1 Conditional Tests:
# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of 
# each test. Your code should look something like this:
#    
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
#
# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and another five tests evaluate to False.
