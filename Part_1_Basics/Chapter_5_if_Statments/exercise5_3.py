# Exercise 5.3 Alien Color #1:
# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called 
# alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
#
# • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, 
#   print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that 
#   fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
