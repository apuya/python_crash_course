# Exercise 13.5 Sideways Shooter Part 2:
# We’ve come a long way since Exercise 12-6, Sideways Shooter. For this exercise, try to develop Sideways Shooter to the same 
# point we’ve brought Alien Invasion to. Add a fleet of aliens, and make them move sideways toward the ship. Or, write code that 
# places aliens at ran- dom positions along the right side of the screen and then sends them toward the ship. Also, write code 
# that makes the aliens disappear when they’re hit.
