# Exercise 14.7 Expanding the Game:
# Think of a way to expand Alien Invasion. For example, you could program the aliens to shoot bullets down at the ship or add 
# shields for your ship to hide behind, which can be destroyed by bullets from either side. Or use something like the pygame.mixer 
# module to add sound effects, such as explosions and shooting sounds.
