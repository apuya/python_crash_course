# Exercise 14.2 Target Practice:
# Create a rectangle at the right edge of the screen that moves up and down at a steady rate. Then have a ship appear on the left 
# side of the screen that the player can move up and down while firing bullets at the moving, rectangular target. Add a Play button 
# that starts the game, and when the player misses the target three times, end the game and make the Play but- ton reappear. Let the 
# player restart the game with this Play button.
