# Exercise 14.1 Press P to Play:
# Because Alien Invasion uses keyboard input to control the ship, it would be useful to start the game with a keypress. 
# Add code that lets the player press P to start. It might help to move some code from _check _play_button() to a _start_game() 
# method that can be called from _check_play _button() and _check_keydown_events().
