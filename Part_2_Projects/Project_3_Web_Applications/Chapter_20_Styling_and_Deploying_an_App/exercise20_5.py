# Exercise 20.5 Extended Learning Log:
# Add one feature to Learning Log, and push the change to your live deployment. Try a simple change, such as writing more about the 
# project on the home page. Then try adding a more advanced feature, such as giving users the option of making a topic public. This 
# would require an attribute called public as part of the Topic model (this should be set to Falseby default) and a form element on 
# the new_topic page that allows the user to change a topic from private to public. You’d then need to migrate the project and revise 
# views.py so any topic that’s public is visible to unauthenticated users as well. Remember to migrate the live database after you’ve 
# pushed your changes to Heroku.
