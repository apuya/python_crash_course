# Exercise 16.1 Sitka Rainfall:
# Sitka is in a temperate rainforest, so it gets a fair amount of rainfall. In the data file sitka_weather_2018_simple.csv is a 
# header called PRCP, which represents daily rainfall amounts. Make a visualization focusing on the data in this column. You can 
# repeat the exercise for Death Valley if youâ€™re curi- ous how little rainfall occurs in a desert.
