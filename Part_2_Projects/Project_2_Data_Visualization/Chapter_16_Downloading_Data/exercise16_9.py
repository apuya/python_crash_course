# Exercise 16.9 World Fires:
#In the resources for this chapter, youâ€™ll find a file called world_fires_1_day.csv. This file contains information about fires burning 
# in dif- ferent locations around the globe, including the latitude and longitude, and the brightness of each fire. Using the data 
# processing work from the first part of this chapter and the mapping work from this section, make a map that shows which parts of 
# the world are affected by fires.
# You can download more recent versions of this data at

# format in the TXT section.
